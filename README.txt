INTRODUCTION
------------

Ubercart QuickPay is the payment gateway module for Drupal version 8 and above.
The module uses the Danish Payment Gateway ‘QuickPay’ to make payment.

The module supports two different payment methods

 * QuickPay Embedded method and
 * QuickPay Form method

QuickPay Embedded – QuickPay Embedded method accepts payment
through Credit card.
It won’t redirect users to the QuickPay hosted payment window. That makes
the payment process quick and easy.

Checkout must be HTTPS secured and PCI verified in order to receive payment
through QuickPay Embedded method for any Drupal system.

QuickPay Form – QuickPay Form method lets you get payment via QuickPay
hosted payment window. It supports multiple languages and accepts
different payment methods.

It supports multiple languages like English, Spanish, Danish, French etc.
You can opt for any of the payment method from Master card, visa card etc.

This module does have the payment refund functionality.
But, you can’t do partial refund using the QuickPay Embedded payment method.
Payment must be captured by the system to make it valid for the refund.
That can be done manually as well as automatically.
You can enable the auto capture in order to activate the
instant refund of the payment.

Auto capture payment option is a default setting for
the QuickPay Embedded method.
You can also do that in QuickPay Form method

If you will enable both the method for the payment with QuickPay
then you need to select payment method first on checkout page otherwise
entered detail will be lost (Page will refrsh on select method).

Cart detail validation is the must while using the QuickPay Embedded method.
So, when users will select the QuickPay Embedded payment method,
he page will automatically get refreshed to verify the card details
and proceed with the payment process.
